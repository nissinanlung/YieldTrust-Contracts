- **Mitigations**: Multi-sig, HSM/MPC, rotation procedures

#### 2. Oracle Manipulation
- **Impact**: Incorrect KPI multipliers, payment manipulation
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Mitigations**: Price deviation checks, sanity oracle, heartbeat monitoring

#### 3. Reentrancy Attacks

- **Likelihood**: Low (requires dual compromise)
- **Mitigations**: Separate approver roles, time windows, audit logging

### Medium-Severity Threats

#### 1. Legal Compliance Bypass
- **Impact**: Regulatory violations, fund streaming without agreements
- **Mitigations**: On-chain signature requirements, legal hash storage

#### 2. Math Overflow/Underflow
- **Impact**: Incorrect calculations, fund loss

## Security Controls

### Access Control

1. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - Admin: Full protocol control
   - Oracle: KPI multiplier updates
   - Recipient: Withdrawals and rage quits

2. **Authentication Requirements**
   - `require_auth()` for all privileged operations
   - Role-specific validation functions

3. **Multi-Sig Recommendations**
   - Minimum 2-of-3 for admin operations
   - Separate keys for different functions

4. **Double-Approval System**
   - Dual authorization for high-value payouts
   - Configurable value thresholds
   - Time-based approval windows
   - Separate approver roles (admin + oracle)

### Reentrancy Protection

```rust
// Implementation in reentrancy.rs
pub fn reentrancy_enter(env: &Env) {
    if env.storage().temporary().has(&GuardKey::NonReentrant) {
        panic_with_error!(env, REENTRANT_ERROR_CODE);
    }
    env.storage().temporary().set(&GuardKey::NonReentrant, &true);
}

// Usage pattern
pub fn withdraw(env: Env, grant_id: u64, amount: i128) -> Result<(), Error> {
    nonreentrant!(env, {
        // Function logic here
    })
}
```

### Circuit Breakers

1. **Oracle Price Deviation Guard**
   - 50% deviation threshold
   - Sanity oracle confirmation required
   - Automatic freeze on suspicious prices

2. **TVL Velocity Limit**
   - 20% drain threshold in 6-hour window
   - Soft pause on breach
   - Admin verification required to resume

### Legal Compliance

1. **Document Hashing**
   - Legal document CID storage
   - Signature requirements
   - Streaming prevention until compliance

2. **Validator Tax**
   - 5% ecosystem tax allocation
   - Separate accounting for validator shares
   - Transparent reporting
